<P><B>1. Calculated overlap</B></P>
<P>Use the calculated overlap when your stock is low. The calculated
overlap is the smallest overlap that can be used without causing
technical problems when framing and is the most cost effective.</P>
<P><BR><B>2. Fixed border overlap</B></P>
<P>Use fixed border overlap to expedite board cutting. In this case
all the bottom boards are cut at the same width. The framer specifies
the width to use for fixed border overlap in the Method Preference
window. An example would be a design in which four boards are used
and all three the bottom boards are cut at a width of 40mm.   
</P>
<P><BR><B>3. Custom Overlap</B></P>
<P>When a board is added to a design, it is possible to define custom
overlaps for the particular board. This is done by selecting the
custom overlap checkbox when the Add Board dialog is displayed. Enter
the preferred overlaps and click on OK. 
</P>
<P><BR><B>4. Full size</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">All the outside measurements off all
the boards are the same as that of the top board.</P>
<P><BR><B>5. Full bottoms</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For all the above methods, it can be
specified to use full bottoms. In this case the bottom border of each
board is extended to the outermost board's bottom edge.</P>
