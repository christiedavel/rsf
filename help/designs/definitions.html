			<P>Calculated Overlap</P>

			<P>Competition factor 
			</P>
		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH=521>
			<P>The competition factor allows business owners to alter the
			price of specific material items when the price should differ from
			the normal markup. This is best explained by way of example: A
			business owner may decide to lower the price of a particular item
			and not use the general markup. In this instance, the competition
			factor should be a value less than 1. On the other hand, a
			material item may be very fragile. The business owner may then
			decide to price the item above the normal markup in order to
			compensate for the handling risk. The competition factor should
			then be a value higher than 1. The default value is 1, meaning
			that the competition factor has no effect on the price.</P>
