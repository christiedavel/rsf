<P><FONT SIZE=6><B>Adding items to a design</B></FONT></P>
<P><B>1. Boards</B></P>
<P>To add a new board to a design, click on the <A HREF="../intro/maintoolbar.html"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">add
board</FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"> </FONT>button or select
Designs | Add | Add board. The Add board dialog will be displayed.
Select the itemcode or owncode of the preferred board. Specify the
face values of the new board and click on OK. The new board will be
the outermost item in the design.</P>
<P>If all the <A HREF="definitions.html"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">face</FONT></A>
values are the same, select the match all check box (selected by
default) and only enter the top face. All the other faces will be the
same as the top face.</P>
<P>If the board is floating,
select the floating board check box. Enter the offset values as
required. Again, if all the offsets are the same, select the match
all check box and only specify the top offset.</P>
<P>If you want to specify custom <A HREF="designmethods.html"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">overlaps</FONT></A>
for the design, click on the custom overlaps check box and enter the
overlaps.</P>
<P>When a design does not have an artwork, the innermost board will
be treated as an artwork. It will thus not be possible to edit any
face, offset or overlap values for this board.</P>
<P><BR><B>2. Frames</B></P>
<P>To add a frame to a design, click on the <A HREF="../intro/maintoolbar.html"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">add
frame</FONT></A> button or select Designs | Add | Add frame. The Add
frame dialog will be displayed. Select the itemcode or owncode of the
preferred frame. The new frame will be the outermost item in the
design.</P>
<P>NOTE: It is important to check the frame rebate of the frame you
choose. The suppliers specified a value of 6mm but we have found that
the actual value is often as large as 10mm for heavier frames. If you
change the rebate value on the frame dialog the database will
automatically be updated for the particular itemcode.</P>
<P>If the frame is floating,
select the floating frame check box. Enter the offset values as
required. If all the offsets are the same, select the match all check
box and only specify the top offset.</P>
<P>It will only be possible to add a frame to a design if it already
contains at least an artwork or a board.</P>
<P><BR><B>3. Glass</B> 
</P>
<P>To add a glass to a design, click on the <A HREF="../intro/maintoolbar.html"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">add
glass</FONT></A> button or select Designs | Add | Add glass. 
</P>
<P>The Add glass dialog will be displayed. Select the itemcode or
owncode of the preferred glass. 
</P>
<P>A list of items currently in the design will be displayed. Select
the item to which you want to match the measurements of the glass.
Then select if you want to match the glass to that item's outer or
inner measurements. Click on OK to complete the process.</P>
<P>It will only be possible to add glass to a design if it already
contains at least an artwork or a board.</P>
<P><BR><B>4. Backing board</B></P>
<P>To add a backing board to a design, click on the <A HREF="../intro/maintoolbar.html"><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">add
back</FONT></A> button or select Designs | Add | Add back. 
</P>
<P>The Add back dialog will be displayed. Select the itemcode or
owncode of the preferred backing board. 
</P>
<P>A list of items currently in the design will be displayed. Select
the item to which you want to match the measurements of the backing
board. Then select if you want to match the backing board to that
item's outer or inner measurements. Click on OK to complete the
process.</P>
<P>It will only be possible to add backing board to a design if it
already contains at least an artwork or a board.</P>
