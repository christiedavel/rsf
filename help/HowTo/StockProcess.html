<P><B><FONT SIZE=6>The Stock Process in RSF</FONT></B> 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><B>1. Introduction</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>The aim of the RSF Stock Control system is to ensure
that the stock figures displayed in RSF are a true representation of
the physical stock in your business. In theory, the quantity of stock
can only change if one of the following events occur: </FONT>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>New Stock arrives (increase the amount of stock)</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Offcuts are posted ( increase the amount of
	stock)</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>A design is created (decrease the amount of
	stock)</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Stock units are sold (decrease the amount of
	stock)</FONT></P>
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><B>2. New Stock is ordered</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>The material information must be captured before
material items can be added to the stock of your business. See the
Capturing of Information section for help with <A HREF="../capturing/materials.html">capturing
material data</A>. In addition, the <I>Howto</I> manual has
step-by-step directions for the capturing of new material details. It
is also possible to download all material information from the
internet. Note that the fact that the material information has been
captured, does not mean that it is automatically added to the stock. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>After the stock has been ordered, the following will
happen:<BR>1. Physical stock arrives from the supplier.<BR>2. Stock
entered into in RSF Stock Control System.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4><B>Enter stock into the RSF Stock Control System as
follow:</B></FONT></P>
<OL TYPE=i>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Select Stock | Orders In on the Main menu.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>The Orders In dialog will be displayed as shown
	below.<BR></FONT></P>
	<P><IMG SRC="MOrdersIn.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=730 HEIGHT=504 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT SIZE=4><BR>Enter
	all the relevant order information that will appear on the delivery
	note or invoice. Make sure that the following information has been
	entered correctly before saving: </FONT>
	</P>
	<UL>
		<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Date (If the correct date has not been
		specified, click on the ellipses button to select the date.)</FONT></P>
		<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Enter the invoice number. </FONT>
		</P>
	</UL>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Click on the 
	<IMG SRC="../../images/NewDesign.gif" NAME="Graphic23" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>
	button to ad a new record to the grid. It will then be possible to
	enter the details of the material items. When the Type, Supplier or
	Item Code cells are selected, an small arrow appears in the cell.
	Click on the arrow to display a dropdown box. If the information is
	entered in a left to right sequence with Material Type first, then
	Supplier and followed by the Item Code, the dropdown boxes will act
	as filters. For example, only the item codes of the selected
	supplier will appear in the dropdown box in the item code column.
	The item code dropdown box will only appear if a supplier has been
	specified. Dropdown boxes do not appear when entering the length,
	width or number of items. The width of frames need not be specified.

	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>The 
	<IMG SRC="../../images/Delete2.gif" NAME="Graphic24" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>

	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Save the information regularly by clicking the
	Save (<IMG SRC="../../images/SaveDesign.gif" NAME="Graphic25" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>)
	button.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>When new material information is saved, a
	stock-id is generated for every stock item. The stock-id's that has
	been generated for the specific material items of the selected entry
	in the grid, will be displayed in the Stock ID listbox. This can be
	seen in the figure below. Seven stock-id's are displayed in the
	Stock Id listbox, because seven lengths of frame xxx-9001 has been
	ordered. If the next record in the grid should be selected, the five
	stock-id's of frame xx-9000 will be displayed in the listbox. The
	aim is to allocated a unique stock-id to each of the ordered
	material items.<BR></FONT></P>

	<IMG SRC="../../images/Close.gif" NAME="Graphic26" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>
	button.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>If needed, it is possible to specify the
	location of stock items. Select Stock | Current stock on the main
	toolbar. The Current Stock window will be displayed. The location of
	single items can be specified by selecting the stock id in the Stok
	Id listbox before entering the location, or by toggeling the radio
	buttons to Single Items before specifying a location. The location
	of grouped items are specified by toggeling the radio buttons to
	Group Items. Grouped items are then displayed in the grid. Make sure
	that a stock-id has not been selected in the Stokd Id listbox before
	entering the location. Click on the close button (<IMG SRC="../../images/Close.gif" NAME="Graphic27" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>)
	to close the window. The location will be saved automatically.</FONT></P>
</OL>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><B>3. Allocate material to a Design</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Before material can be allocated, an existing design
must be selected or a new design created. See the Designs section for
help with <A HREF="../designs/creatingnewdesign.html">creating a new
design</A>. In addition, the Howto manual has step-by-step
directions. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Allocate stock to a design after the design has been
finalised, by clicking on the Allocate stock to Design button (<IMG SRC="../../images/Stocker.gif" NAME="Graphic19" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>).
The following window will be displayed. </FONT>
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="MAllocateStock.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=700 HEIGHT=504 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT SIZE=4><BR>Before
displaying the above window, the RSF software will attempt to
optimise the allocation of stock. If it was successful, suggested
material items will be selected. The user only need to confirm the
RSF selection, but also has the option of changing it. If the
optimization of stock allocation was not possible, no stock items
will be selected in this window when it opens. The user then need to
select the stock items needed for the design. This process can be
simplified by using the material type filter at the top of the
window. Only the selected material type will be listed and that will
streamline the selection of material items. Please note that stock
allocation is not done according to the design name, but according to
the design code. This is to prevent confusion in instances where more
than one design may have the same design name. When satisfied with
the selected material items, click on the Allocate button to save the
stock allocation of the design. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>It is possible to navigate to another design without
closing this window by simply selecting another design code from the
dropdown box. If another design code has been selected without
clicking the Allocate button first, the user will be asked if the new
selection must be updated. If the user clicks the<I> No </I>button,
the allocation information will be lost. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>After material items has been allocated to a specific
design, the selected items will be locked, and it will not be
possible to use the same items in other designs. It is possible to
change the stock allocation. Simply repeat the process described
above. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Close this window by clicking the 
<IMG SRC="../../images/Close.gif" NAME="Graphic20" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>
button. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><B>4. Post Offcuts</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>The figure below is an example of the printed offcut
list.</FONT></P>
<P><IMG SRC="MOffcutPrintout.jpg" NAME="Graphic11" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=675 HEIGHT=323 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT SIZE=4>The
offcut list contains all the material items in the design. Measure
the length and width of the offcuts in the space provided. Users have
the option to either post the offcuts immediately or at a later
stage. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>To post offcuts, select Stock | Offcuts on the Main
toolbar. The offcut window will be displayed as shown below. </FONT>
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="MPostOffcuts.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=650 HEIGHT=454 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT SIZE=4><BR>Post
the offcuts as follow:</FONT></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Ensure that the correct date has been selected</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Select the Design Code for which offcuts are to
	be posted.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Click on the 
	<IMG SRC="../../images/Add.gif" NAME="Graphic21" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>
	button to create a new entry.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Supply the required material information. Note
	that the Stock Id is not accessible.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Click on the Save button (<IMG SRC="../../images/SaveDesign.gif" NAME="Graphic22" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>).
	RSF will then generate a new Stock Id for the material items.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Mark the offcuts with their new Stock Id and
	return the item to the stock storeroom.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>If needed, it is possible to specify the
	location of each material item as described above.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=4>Repeat the above steps for
	each of the offcut material items.</FONT></FONT></P>
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>The process described above requires that the framing
process itself be organised in a specific way. If users should choose
not to post the offcuts immediately after the materials for each
design has been cut, it is recommended that a intermediary shelve be
created. All the offcuts are put on the intermediary shelve, grouped
together according to design. Offcuts on the intermediary shelve are
then posted at regular intervals. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><B>5. Removing stock from the RSF Stock Control
System </B></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>RSF realise that it is sometimes necessary to remove
stock form the system without using it in a design. This will
typically happen when stock is returned to the supplier or in
instances where stock my be sold as is. Stock can be removed by
selecting Stock | Sales and Returns from the main menu. The following
window will be displayed. </FONT>
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="MStockSale.jpg" NAME="Graphic15" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=607 HEIGHT=432 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><FONT SIZE=4><BR>Select
the stock items you want sell or return to the supplier and click the
sell button. Follow these steps when stock needs to be removed from
the RSF Stock Control System for whatever reason. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><B>6. Stock Take</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>In most types of business stocktaking is a
timeconsuming process and needs to be planned in advance. The RSF
Stock Control System does, however, go a long way to streamline the
process. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>Navigate to the Stock Taking window by selecting
Stock | Stock Take on the main toolbar. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>When the Stock Take window opens, click on the 
<IMG SRC="../../images/NewDesign.gif" NAME="Graphic28" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>
button to start a new stock-take session. Add material items to the
stock-take session as follow: </FONT>
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Ensure that the correct date has been selected</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Click on the 
	<IMG SRC="../../images/Add.gif" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>
	button to create a new entry.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Supply the required details for each material
	item. If information is entered in a left to right sequence,
	dropdown boxes will appear which will act as filters in order to
	streamline datacapturing.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Regularly click the Save button (<IMG SRC="../../images/SaveDesign.gif" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>).</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>When the Save button is clicked, a new Stock ID
	will be generated for each material item.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Mark each material item with it's new Stock ID
	and return the item to the store.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>It is not mandatory to complete the stock take
	in one big session, as it is possible to exit the stock take session
	and return to it later.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>When the stock take is finished, click the
	Complete button. Note that once the user has clicked the Complete
	button, it will not be possible to re-open the stock take session.</FONT></P>
	<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4>Click on the Close button (<IMG SRC="../../images/Close.gif" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>)
	to close the window.</FONT></P>
</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>After the stock take has been completed, view the
discrepancies by selecting Stock | Discrepancies on the main toolbar.
The following window will be opened: </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4><IMG SRC="MDiscrepancies.png" NAME="Graphic29" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=700 HEIGHT=504 BORDER=0></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>This window displays discrepancies found during the
stocktake. By selecting the dates of previous stock-takes in the
dropdown box, it is possible to compare discrepancies of different
stock-takes. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>The business owner needs to determine the level of
acceptable discrepancy and balance that with time constraints within
the business. When the accuracy of offcut measurement increases, the
level of discrepancy will decrease and vica versa. Accurately
measuring offcuts is, however, more timeconsuming and the business
owner under severe time pressure may decide to accept higher levels
of discrepancy. </FONT>
