<P><FONT SIZE=6><B>Creating a Design</B></FONT></P>
<P>RSF needs the attributes of each of the material items in a design
in order to calculate the price of the design and the cutting list.
As a result all material items that will be used in the design must
be entered into the RSF materials database before the design is
created. See the Capturing of Information section for help with
<A HREF="../capturing/materials.html">capturing material data</A>. In
addition, the <I>Howto</I> manual has step-by-step directions for the
capturing of new material details. 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=5><B>Saving scanned artworks in the correct format</B></FONT></P>
<P>The format of a file can be obtained by looking at the extension
of the file. For example, the extension of the Microsoft Word file
'<I>LetterToJohn.doc</I>' is <I>doc.</I> Only picture files of type
'<I>gif</I>' or '<I>jpg</I>' can be used in RSF. An example of such
files would be <I>'MonaLisa.gif'</I> or <I>'MonaLisa.jpg'</I>. 
</P>
<P>Sometimes the extention of files are not displayed. In such
instances, <I>“LetterToJohn”</I> wil be displayed in stead of
<I>“LetterToJohn.doc”</I>. If you have Microsoft Windows, try the
following to display the file extentions:

<P><FONT SIZE=5><B>Material Attributes</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>The design created in this example will consist of
the artwork itself, mount board 1, mount board 2, a slip, the frame,
glass and a back. These material items have the following attributes:
</FONT>
</P>
<P><B>The Artwork</B><BR>RSF gives you an option to use a default
picture to represent all artworks, a default colour can be used to
represent artworks, or the artwork can be scanned. If the artwork is
scanned, make sure that it is saved with either a <I>jpg</I> or <I>gif</I>
extension. Save the picture file in the following the directory:<BR><I>&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;RSF Installation directory&gt;\images\Artworks</I><BR>RSF will search in this
directory for images during the design process.</P>
<P>In this example the following picture will be framed. The filename
of this picture is <I>'darkdunes-t.jpg'</I> and it has been saved in
the appointed directory. 
</P>

(There is a difference in the bottom and top face) 
</P>
<P><B>Slip</B><BR>Item Code = C1A<BR>Rebate = 6 mm (Double check this
measurement)</P>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> Before using a slip or a frame for the first time,
double check the rebate measurements. If rebate measurements are
wrongly specified in RSF, the cutting list will be faulty. At RSF we
will take every precaution to ensure that measurements are correct,
but we do find that the rebate measurements are not consistent. We
would thus recommend that users double check the rebate of all frames
and slips before using it for the first time.

this measurement)</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=5><B>Procedure for creating a new design</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=4>The following is a step-by-step explanation of the
process that needs to be followed when creating a new design.</FONT> 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Open a new design by clicking on the 
	<IMG SRC="../../images/NewDesign.gif" NAME="Graphic31" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>
	button. Note that users can save the design throughout the design
	process to prevent loss of information.</P>
	<LI><P>The following window will be displayed.<BR></P>
	<P><IMG SRC="MAddArtwork.png" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=204 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>Enter
	the sight line measurements of the artwork in the space provided.
	Note that the sight line measurements will usually be smaller than
	the size of the artwork itself. A colour can be selected to
	represent the artwork, or if the artwork was scanned and saved in
	the correct directory, the artwork can be selected from the dropdown
	box. If the artwork is not to be added at this stage, select none.</P>
	<LI><P>The follwing window will be displayed after the filename
	<I>'darkdunes-t.jpg'</I> has been selected.<BR></P>
	<P><IMG SRC="MDArtwork.png" NAME="Graphic4" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=763 HEIGHT=469 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
	<LI><P>Add mount board 1 by clicking the 
	<IMG SRC="../../images/BoardAdd.gif" NAME="Graphic23" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=21 BORDER=0>
	button. The following window will be displayed.<BR></P>
	<P><IMG SRC="MBoardAdd.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=294 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>Select
	the item code from the Item Code dropdown box. If the colour
	displayed on the screen does not match the colour of the board,
	click on the colour indicator and select a more appropriate colour.
	Note that an item code must be selected before the colour indicator
	will become active. The colour chooser has three different methods
	of selecting colours. Users can choose the method which they find to
	work the easiest. 
	</P>
	<P>There are variation in the rendering of colours by different
	computer screens and as a result users must specify the colours
	themselves. Once specified however, the colours will be rendered the
	same in consecutive designs. 
	</P>
	<P>Users also has the option to specify cutom overlaps. If custom
	overlaps are not enabled, RSF will apply the settings specified in
	the Method Preferences. 
	</P>
	<P>Enter the face measurement values of the edges. If the user wants
	the face measurements of all four edges to be equal, the <I>Match
	All</I> checkbox should be checked. In this instance, it will only
	be necessary to supply the top face measurement.</P>
	<LI><P>Click OK to return to the main window. Repeat the process to
	add mount board 2. When adding mount board 2, do not check the <I>Match
	All</I> checkbox and enter the different face measurements of all
	four edges. After both mount boards have been added, the design will
	be diplayed in the main window as shown below.<BR></P>
	<P><IMG SRC="MDBoard.png" NAME="Graphic6" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=771 HEIGHT=503 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
	<LI><P>Add a slip to the design by selecting the material item which will be on
	the outside of the slip and click the 
	<IMG SRC="../../images/SlipAdd.gif" NAME="Graphic24" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>
	button. The following window will be displayed. <B>Note:</B> Select
	material items by clicking on the item in the graphical display or
	by double-clicking on the material item in the material item list.
	Remember to double check the rebate measurement.<BR></P>
	<P><IMG SRC="MSlipAdd.png" NAME="Graphic7" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=204 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR>Select
	the correct slip from the item code dropdown box and adjust the
	colour if needed. Click on the OK button.</P>
	<LI><P>Add a frame by clicking on the 
	<IMG SRC="../../images/FrameAdd.gif" NAME="Graphic25" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=21 BORDER=0>
	button. The following window will be displayed. Remember to double
	check the measurements of the rebate. Do this by selecting Materials
	| Frames on the Main toolbar and then locating the frame by using
	the find (<IMG SRC="../../images/Find.gif" NAME="Graphic27" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>)
	function.<BR></P>
	<P><IMG SRC="MFrameAdd.png" NAME="Graphic8" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=194 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
	<LI><P>The new design with the slip and frame will now be displayed in the main
	window.<BR></P>
	<P><IMG SRC="MDFrame.png" NAME="Graphic9" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=755 HEIGHT=496 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
	<LI><P>Add glass by clicking on the 
	<IMG SRC="../../images/GlassAdd.gif" NAME="Graphic26" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>
	button. The following window will be displayed. The size of the
	glass is determined by fitting the glass to a certain material item.
	Select the material item to which the glass must fit, in this case
	the frame, and select whether the glass must fit to the inside or
	outside of that material item.<BR>
	</P>
	<P><IMG SRC="MGlassAdd.png" NAME="Graphic10" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=284 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
	<LI><P>Add the back by clicking on the 
	<IMG SRC="../../images/BackAdd.gif" NAME="Graphic28" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>
	button. The following window will be displayed. The size of the back
	is determined by fitting the back to a certain material item. As in
	the case with the glass, select the material item to which the glass
	must fit and specify whether it must fit to the inside or outside of
	that material item.<BR></P>
	<P><IMG SRC="MBackAdd.png" NAME="Graphic11" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=284 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><P>
	<LI><P>The finished design will then be graphically displayed in the main
	window. Add client details by clicking on the 
	<IMG SRC="../../images/ToClients.gif" NAME="Graphic29" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>
	button and artist details by clicking on the 
	<IMG SRC="../../images/ToArtists.gif" NAME="Graphic30" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>
	button or select an existing client and artist from the dropdown
	boxes. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Print a cutting list and a stock list by setting the design
	status to '<I>In Order</I>' and then clicking on the Print (<IMG SRC="../../images/Print.gif" NAME="Graphic2" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0>)
	button.
