<P>There is a seperate window for each of the different material
types. All the windows are found under the Materials menu.

<P>The itemcode and owncode of all the materials must be unique. If
an owncode is not supplied, one will automatically be generated.

different suppliers. When adding new material items, start by first
entering the basic information of the new material item (ie itemcode,
owncode, group, color, status and description). Then click on the

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>3. Import materials via the Internet</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">RSF realise that entering the material
information manually can be a very time consuming process. We have
thus made it possible to automatically import the latest material
information over the internet. This process will take a fraction of
the time needed to manually enter all material information. In
addition, the information will be more accurate and the framer will
have a much larger range of available materials to select from.
Another advantage is that the framer will be able to easily compare
prices of the different suppliers. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In order to use the import feature,
make sure you are connected to the internet. If you are satisfied
that you have an active connection, select Materials | Import. Click
on the Import button when the import window is opened. The progress
will be displayed in the window as the materials are imported. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Once completed, click OK.</P>
