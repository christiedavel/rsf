<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Welcome to RSF. It is a well known fact
that picture framing is a labour intensive process. Add to this the
fact that the picture framer spends a great deal of time consulting
with clients and needs to be able to make swift stock decisions in
order to give professional advice on availability and price, and one
begins to understand why it is difficult to have adequate control
over the amounts of materials used. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">We at RSF understand the problems that
picture framers face and we are confident that RSF will bring a new
dimension to your business in that it will provide a means to speed
up and simplify the design and quotation process. In addition it will
also give the business owner improved control over stock.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">See the following for an introduction
to the RSF environment.</P>
